### Body
Summary: Should be short, no prose

Notes
Django differs from web development 10 years ago. Instead of everything being in a static page (or even just having its own dedicated url), most websites are built using apps (that can be used in multiple places).

```ad-note
title: Projects vs. apps

What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something – e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
