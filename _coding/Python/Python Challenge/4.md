This one was confusing untill I clicked on the image. 



```python

from urllib.request import urlopen
import re

uri = "http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php?nothing=%s"

num = "12345"
#num = str(16044/2)

pattern = re.compile("and the next nothing is (\d+)")

while True:
    content = urlopen(uri % num).read().decode('utf-8')
    print(content)
    match = pattern.search(content)
    if match == None:
        break
    num = match.group(1)

    

    
```
This is the final working code.

```python
import re
```

is for importing regular expressions. so when it is used in:

```python
pattern = re.compile("and the next nothing is (\d+)")
```
it compiles it and looks for the string followed by a number
