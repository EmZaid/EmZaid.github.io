This is a place for me to collect differnt things I am learning about the various languages I interact with. Right now it mostly focuses on python, and I am slowly transfering my notes over. 

The languages that will eventually show up here probably are:
1. Python
2. Go
3. Rust
4. Javascript/Typescript
5. C (various forms)
6. VBA?
7. Powershell
8. Bash
9. Ruby
