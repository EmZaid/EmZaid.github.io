I ran into [stegosploit](https://stegosploit.info/) while working on a HTB box. It was definitely a rabbit hole but one that was quite fun. 

I couldn't find the source code anywhere, and in stego fashion had to extract it out of the pdf (which you can find [here](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo08.pdf)).

Once you read through the article you had to run:

```bash
unzip pocorgtfo08.pdf stegosploit_tool.png
```
Which gives us this image

If you follow the directions you end up getting a zip file when you click on the image you open in your browser.
