Èmilienne (they/she) loves learning new things. She has a love of cybersecurity, cats, Factorio, and Deleuze. They also enjoy participating on hack the box, tryhackme, and CTF's (she recently participated in [NahamCon 2022](https://ctf.nahamcon.com/)). This is a space for publishing and refining some of the notes she takes as they learns. She also fosters cats and enjoys working with cats that don't like them.
